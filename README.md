# perc_bot-revamped

Originally made by hanss314, this version is/will be modified for Heroku deployment.
Based on an even older version of the one found in this repository: https://github.com/hanss314/percbot

This project adheres to Semantic Versioning post v1.0.0, which is defined as commit f059c5a "Remove Bug Finding print()" (https://github.com/RandomGamer123/perc_bot-revamped/commit/f059c5ac8583be10f409f541df5218ccd4453b1f)
For version definitions see version.md

You can use this yourself following the license, but fair warning, you need to manage the database a bit for setup, if you are using Heroku Postgres like me. Contact me on Discord for more info.
