# perc_bot-revamped

Originally made by hanss314, this version is/will be modified for Heroku deployment.
Based on an even older version of the one found in this repository: https://github.com/hanss314/percbot.

This is a Discord bot maintained from the original all the way from 2017 by hanss314 that facilitates the hosting of minigames with items that contestants can use. Originally forked for hosting an imitation of nerd's ShopTWOW, this bot has been maintained along with a custom modification of the discord.py library based on v0.16.12 (see https://github.com/RandomGamer123/discord.py-unofficial for more details) to make it still work despite all the changes to the Discord API over the years in case I do want to host something similar in the future.

~~This project adheres to Semantic Versioning post v1.0.0, which is defined as commit f059c5a "Remove Bug Finding print()" (https://github.com/RandomGamer123/perc_bot-revamped/commit/f059c5ac8583be10f409f541df5218ccd4453b1f)
For version definitions see version.md~~

Versioning discontinued due to this being solely updated to make it function and being mostly useless.

You can use this yourself following the license, but fair warning, you need to manage the database a bit for setup, if you are using Heroku Postgres like me. Contact me on Discord for more info.
